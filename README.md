# DAY 3 — GIT MASTERY: RESET, REVERT, CHERRY-PICK,
BISECT, STASH

## Learning Outcomes
- Ability to recover from mistakes
- Proper commit discipline

## Summary
For Day 3, a Git repository with multiple commits was created to practice advanced Git workflows. A bug was intentionally introduced and later identified using `git bisect`. The faulty commit was safely undone using `git revert` without rewriting history. A stash workflow was used to preserve uncommitted work during updates. Additionally, a merge conflict was created using two clones of the same repository and resolved manually while keeping both changes, demonstrating correct collaborative Git practices.

## Deliverables
- `bisect-session.txt`
- `stash-session.txt`
- `MERGE-POSTMORTEM.md`
